# Polar Bromine Model Intercomparison

## Description 
Our plan is to compare and evaluate 3D atmospheric models which include polar halogen sources and reproduce surface ozone depletion. Models will be evaluated against in situ and satellite observations in the Arctic from Spring 2012 and Spring 2020.

## How to Join
Email jennie.thomas@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr with your github login to be added to this repository (https://github.com/jenniethomas/arctic-bromine-model-intercomp/) and to the project's google group (https://groups.google.com/g/arcbromintercomp).

## Simulation instructions for Spring 2012 and Spring 2020 case studies
Spring 2012 case study:
- Simulation dates: 2012/03/01 00 UTC to 2012/06/01 00 UTC (+ appropriate model spinup so that March 1st data is usable)
- Simulation domain (for regional models): needs to include the whole Arctic above the Arctic Circle

Spring 2020 case study:
- Simulation dates 2020/03/01 00 UTC to 2020/06/01 00 UTC (+ appropriate model spinup so that March 1st data is usable)
- Simulation domain (for regional models): needs to include the whole Arctic above the Arctic Circle

There are no other requirements for emissions, driving meteorological data or other detailed model setup options.

## Observations used for the comparisons, required model output
See detailed  instructions in instructions.md (https://github.com/jenniethomas/arctic-bromine-model-intercomp/blob/main/instructions.md)
