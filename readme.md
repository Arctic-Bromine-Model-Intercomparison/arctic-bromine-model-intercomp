# Plans for a Polar Bromine Model Intercomparsion 
- Email jennie.thomas@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr with yoru github login to be added to this repo to edit

## Confrimed particpating groups, models, & main contacts
- To be listed after call

## To do - once you sign up 
> create a readme file here about about your model (example naming: Readme-WRF-chem-marelle.md) include these sections
- Last publication of model version with polar halogen chemistry, doi
- Short description of what is included
- Model resolution & driving meterology that you can use
- Note if you can or are you willing to do sensitivty runs with certain processes off?

## Recommended driving met
- ERA5

## Model simulation period
- TBD

## List of model outputs that must be saved
### 3D output
- Sea salt aerosol mass (size and nubmer concnetration if possible)
- wind speeds and wind directions
- Temperature
- Br, BrO, Br2, HOBr 
- Cl, ClO, Cl2, HOCl 
- Ozone
- Pressure
- RH or Specific Humidity

### 2D output
- SST
- BL height
- Ice fraction
- Sea salt aerosol emissions

## Obs that will be used for comparison
### Satellite
- If yes, how we will compare and with which product(s)?

### Station data
- Which ones, what obs?
- SSA, ozone, BrO?

### Ship data
- Whcih ones, depending on year

## Sondes for met profiles



## We will likely ask each group to extract the data at each station rather than centralizing model output for comparison.  To be discussed.
