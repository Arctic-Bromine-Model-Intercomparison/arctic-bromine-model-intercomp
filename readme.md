# Readme for describing plans for a Polar Bromine Model Intercomparsion 
> Email jennie.thomas@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr with yoru github login to be added to this repo to edit

## Confrimed particpating groups, models, & main contacts
-To be listed after call

## To do - once you sign up - clreate a readme file here about yoru model, include these sections:
- Last publication of model version with polar halogen chemistry
- Short description of what is included
- Model resolution & driving meterology that you can use

## Recommended driving met
- ERA5

## Model simulation period
- TBD

## List of model outputs that must be saved
### 3D output
- Sea salt aerosol mass (size and nubmer concnetration if possible)
- wind speeds and wind directions
- Temperature
- Br, BrO, Br2, HOBr 
- Cl, ClO, Cl2, HOCl 
- Ozone
- Pressure
- RH or Specific Humidity

### 2D output
- SST
- BL height
- Ice fraction
- Sea salt aerosol emissions

## Obs that will be used for comparison
### Satellite
- If yes, how we will compare and with which product(s)?

### Station data
- Which ones, what obs?
- SSA, ozone, BrO?

## Ship data
- Whcih ones, depending on year

## Sondes for met profiles



## We will likely ask each group to extract the data at each station rather than centralizing model output for comparison.  To be discussed.
