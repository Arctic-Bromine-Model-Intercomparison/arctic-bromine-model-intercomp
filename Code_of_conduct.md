# Code of conduct for participation in the Arctic Bromine Inter-comparison Project

This code of conduct establishes the standards for expected and unacceptable behavior within the context of the Arctic Bromine Inter-comparison Project. 

## General Conduct
Individuals and teams participating in the Arctic Bromine Model Inter-comparison Project are expected to conduct their activities with the utmost integrity 
and adhere to the highest ethical standards. All individuals should be treated with respect, and participants must abstain from any form of discrimination, harassment, or 
bullying during any activity related to the project. In instances where members witness or become aware of such behavior by others, they are requested to actively prevent, 
report, and/or mitigate the offensive conduct.

## Research Conduct
Participants shall uphold the principles of scientific integrity in their research activities as part of the Arctic Bromine Model Inter-comparison Project. 
Scientific misconduct, including fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, is strictly prohibited. Involuntary scientific errors or misinterpretations that may arise 
during the research process are not considered misconduct but should be promptly addressed.
Participants are expected to avoid detrimental research practices, maintain fairness and objectivity as peer reviewers, 
correct any errors in their own work promptly, include all deserving authors in publications, and appropriately credit prior work in citations.

## Team Interactions
We strive to exhibit considerate speech and actions, actively recognizing and respecting 
the boundaries and experiences of our fellow community members. Specifically, we aim to:
* Respect the time limits and agenda for pre-planned meetings.  
* Ensure inclusive decision-making processes.
* Uphold honesty, accountability, and transparent communication.
* Refrain from making false or offensive statements and avoid aggressive/passive agressive behaviors.
* Refrain from making personal comments or comments on behavior, focusing on the content and scientific analysis during dicussions.

## Reporting
* All team members should report instances of unacceptable conduct promptly to the Arctic Bromine Modeling Inter-comparison Project organizers.  
* All information provided will be treated as anonymous and action will be taken to ensure appropriate behavior in team meetings and written interactions going forward.
